      "summary": "ExtrAcid® is the first system that recycles waste sulfuric acid under pressure using innovative patented loop systems producing high concentrated acid and process steam at the same time.",
      "introduction": "INTRODUCTION",
      "introText1": "Waste sulfuric acid from various chemical processes has to be recycled by removing water and other impurities from the acid. By dewatering the concentration rides from less than 15% to higher values of typically 98%.",
      "introText2": "Typical Acid concentration systems (SAC or SAS or dewatering systems) are separated in to lower concentration of up to 70%, medium and high concentration systems.",

      "steamTitle": "TURN ACID WATER INTO PROCESS STEAM",
      "steamText1": "Well-known is that recycling by vacuum evaporation of water consumes high energy resources. Although the energy consumption has been optimized in recent years valuable energy cannot be recovered due to low temperature levels.",
      "steamText2": "The innovative ExtrAcid® process system is the first that can significantly reduce the energy consumption by producing valuable process steam.",
      "impuritiesTitle": "IMPURITIES",
      "impuritiesText1": "As waste sulfuric acid has many different sources it often contains organic or inorganic impurities other than water which have to be removed. Dependent on the nature of the process typical examples are HF, H₂O₂ or Fe.",
      "impuritiesText2": "It is important to know the kind and amount of the impurities before the design of the ExtrAcid® system. Some organics like H₂O₂ are decomposed into water and O₂ if the temperature is increased sufficiently. Others like HF stay in the vapor phase and can be separated this way. Some need special treatment like purification by crystallization.",
      "impuritiesText3": "ExtrAcid® can offer many solutions to this wide range of challenges. Due to the universal chemical resistance of our main material, it is suitable for HF applications, due to high temperatures it burns many organics into its elements or separates by evaporation.",
      "crystallisationTitle": "PURIFICATION BY CRYSTALLISATION",
      "crystallisationText": "A usual task for the treatment of waste acid coming from the production of Titanium Dioxide is the Fe load in the waste. It can be reduced by forming Ferrous sulphate Monohydrate. These kind of processes can easily be added to the ExtrAcid® system."
